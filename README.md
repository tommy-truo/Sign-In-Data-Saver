# Sign-In Data Saver
**[NOT FINISHED]**
Sign-In Data Saver is a python program that allows users to add, edit, and save sign-in information to a JSON file. Users can easily edit sign-in information for many different websites/applications and save the information to the data file.

**Note**: In the event that the data file is *deleted/corrupted*, the program will *create/overwrite* the previous file, which may result in *losing file data* if the file was corrupted or unreadable.

**Security Note:**

Since the JSON file is *only* saved on your computer and *not* sent to any online server/database, your information *isn't* accessible/editable by anyone else *unless* your computer has some kind of *virus* or your physical *hard drive/ssd* that stored the JSON file was *stolen* from your computer.

Also, the JSON file is currently *not* encrypted by the program. So, your information *is* readable to others if they open the JSON file on your personal computer. This will be changed in the final version of the program. ~~The program currently *doesn't* have a password feature as well, which would only allow the user to see the saved information if the correct password was entered.~~
