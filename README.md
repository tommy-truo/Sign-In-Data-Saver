# Sign-In Data Saver
**[NOT FINISHED]**
Sign-In Data Saver is a python program that allows users to add, edit, and save sign-in information to a JSON file. Users can easily edit sign-in information for many different websites/applications and save the information to the data file.

**Note: In the event that the data file is _deleted/corrupted_, the program will _create/overwrite_ the previous file, which may result in _losing file data_ if the file was corrupted or unreadable.**

**Security Note:**

**Since the JSON file is _only_ saved on your computer and _not_ sent to any online server/database, your information _isn't_ accessible/editable by anyone else _unless_ your computer has some kind of _virus_ or your physical _hard drive/ssd_ that stored the JSON file was _stolen_ from your computer.**

**Also, the JSON file is currently _not_ encrypted by the program. So, your information _is_ readable to others if they open the JSON file on your personal computer. This will be changed in the final version of the program. The program currently doesn't have a password feature as well, which would only allow the user to see the saved information if the correct password was entered.**
