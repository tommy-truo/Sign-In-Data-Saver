# Sign-In Saver
Sign-In Saver is a python 3 program that was created by Tommy Truong and allows users to add, edit, and save sign-in information, which automatically saves in a JSON file. Users can easily and safely save sign-in information for many different websites/applications to an encrypted JSON file on their personal computer.

**Security Note:**

Since the JSON file is *only* saved on your computer and *not* sent to any online server/database, your information *isn't* accessible/editable by anyone else *unless* your physical *hard drive/ssd* that stored the JSON file was *stolen* from your computer.

The program encrypts the JSON file so that the information is completely unintelligible unless the file's contents are decrypted by the program after the user enters the correct password.

## Setup:
Before running the program, make sure to install the modules in the *requirements.txt* file.

## All Options:
After signing into program with the program password the user set up, users can easily *add* new sign-in information (website/application, email, password, username, and phone number), select and *delete* specific sign-in information from the file, *edit* specific parts of selected saved data, *print* all saved data to console, *change the password* used by the program to access user data, and *exit* the program.
